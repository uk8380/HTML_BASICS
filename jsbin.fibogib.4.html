      CHICKEN FIRED RICE:
      </strong> </li><ul>
    <li>To make Chicken Fried Rice, you will need very few ingredients</li>
    <li><strong>Chicken –</strong> I used chicken breast and boiled them until they were cooked properly.
      Then I shred them using a fork.
      You can also use a hand mixer to shred the cooked chicken breast.</li>
    <li><strong>Cornflour –</strong> Coating the shredded chicken in some cornflour and then frying it gives it a nice and crispy texture.
      I also added a little bit of soy sauce to the chicken before frying.</li>
    <li><strong>Sesame Oil –</strong> I fried the rice in sesame oil which gives it a very asian flavour. 
      You can however choose any oil that you like.</li>
    <li><strong>Egg –</strong> If you have ever ordered Chicken Fried Rice from any Asian take away,
      You must have noticed that it always comes with scrambled eggs.</li>
 
    <li><strong>Garlic –</strong> I love garlic in my Asian recipes and I  add a lot of it. </li>
    <li><strong>Spring Onion and Veggies –</strong> These add a nice crunch to the rice. You can chose to add your fav veggies in this rice. 
      Mushroom, broccoli, sweet peas, zucchini etc go well.</li>
    <li><strong>Sauces –</strong> Asian sauces like Soy sauce, Vinegar Red Chilli sauce etc go in this recipe.
      Feel free to adjust the quantity of these according to your taste.</li>
    <li><strong>Rice –</strong> Use short grain rice for a typical Asian style chicken fried rice.</li>
    <li><strong>Also make sure the rice is cooked well in advance and cooled properly before stir frying. A day old rice is the best.</strong></li>
      </ul>
